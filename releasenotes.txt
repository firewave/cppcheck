- The platform 'unix64-unsigned' has been deprecated and will be removed in Cppcheck 2.19. Please use '--platform=unix64 --funsigned-char' instead.
- The "unspecified" platform has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It is also now identical to 'native' (i.e. char type signedness based on compiler instead of unknown).

- Fix checking a project that contains several project file entries for the same file.
- Fixed --file-filter matching of looked up files in provided paths.
- Split up cstyleCast checker; dangerous casts produce portability/warning reports, safe casts produce style reports.
- The possibility of an unknown signedness of the char type in a platform definition has been removed.
- The built-in "win*" and "unix*" platforms will now default to signed char type instead of unknown signedness. If you require unsigned chars please specify "--funsigned-char"
